<h2>Getting Verified</h2>
<p>If you want an venue account, you can go to the <b>Settings</b> page on your profile to get verified. Here you will see a <b>Request Verification</b> button- click this and fill out the form that you are presented with. If you have a pending verification, you will see that here instead.</p>

<h2>Venue Account Features</h2>
<p>As a verified venue, you have a few special features you have access to. First, any event you post that takes place at your venue will be automatically verified.</p>
<p>You will only be automatically added to verified events created by admins. If a normal JamPad user wants to link your account to an event, they have to send you an event request. You can view these in the <b>Notifications</b> screen on your profile under <b>Event Requests</b>.</p>
