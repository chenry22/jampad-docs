<h1 id='title'>Artist Accounts</h1>
<p>On JamPad, there a three different types of verified accounts. The first of these are artists, which are marked with a blue seal.</p>

<p>An artist account signifies that this user can be featured at events. Any events an artist is confirmed to be featured at will show up in a <b>Featured</b> tab on their profile! This will show both past and upcoming events from this artist.</p>

<h2>Getting Verified</h2>
<p>If you want an artist account (and are actually an artist), you can go to the <b>Settings</b> page on your profile to get verified. Here you will see a <b>Request Verification</b> button- click this and fill out the form that you are presented with. If you have a pending verification, you will see that here. This will also verify this event if it's not already verified!</p>

<h2>Artist Account Features</h2>
<p>As a verified artist, you have a few special features you have access to. First, any event you post that includes you will be automatically verified. Also, whenever a verified event is posted that includes you, you will earn 5 FrogCoin!</p>
<p>You may not be able to post every event you are a part of. In the app, if you see an event that lists you, but that your account is not linked to, click on your name to link your account to this event!</p>

</div>
<p>You will only be automatically added to verified events created by admins. If a normal JamPad user wants to link your account to an event, they have to send you an event request. You can view these in the <b>Notifications</b> screen on your profile under <b>Event Requests</b>.</p>

<h2>Artist Collabs</h2>
<p>If you are an artist and you want to collaborate with us, please reach out! This could mean adding your band's merch into the app as frog clothing, setting up a custom reward code, or more!</p>
