<p>There is not a standardized way to request to become a JamPad admin. If you are interested in helping out, reach out to us on Instagram (&#64;jampadapp) or by email (jampadapp&#64;gmail.com). If you are already an established JamPad user and post events, you will be more likely to be accepted as an admin.</p>
